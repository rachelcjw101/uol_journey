Now it's your turn to hack the robot. Here are some basic ideas to get you started:

1. change some numbers in the commands - observe what changes occur

2. comment out commands and see what disappears

3. copy and paste some of the commands and then change the numbers to create variation.

Once you've orientated yourself, try making some more deliberate changes. Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. change the shape of the robot's nose

2. give the robot screwball eyes

3. change the colour of the robot.
